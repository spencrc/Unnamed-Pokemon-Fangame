Currently still a major work-in-progress! For a very experimental but (relatively) non-buggy build in executable form, one is available under the Releases.

If you would like to build the game yourself with the most up to date build, please do the following:
1. Visit the [LÖVE webpage](https://love2d.org/) to install the latest version of the engine.
2. Download the files from this repository from [the master branch](https://github.com/spencrc/Unnamed-Pokemon-Fangame/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
3. Wherever the files (either via the .zip or installer) for LÖVE are located, please move the project's file to this folder.
4. Drag the project's folder onto the **love.exe** or **lovec.exe** files, and the game will run!
